# Terraform and Infrastructure as Code

Terraform is an open source tool built by Hashicorp to automate the provisioning
of infrastructure resources. It is used to build, manage, update and delete 
infrastructure resources like virtual machines, containers, networking and others
using infrastructure as a coding philosophy. Terraform is a vendor agnostic tool 
and can manage infrastructure for multiple resource providers (for example AWS, 
Google Cloud, Azure, Aviatrix, Heroku, Oracle, etc.).

## What is Infrastructure as a Code?

Infrastructure as code means writing code to provision, manage and deploy IT infrastructure. 

## Benefits of Infrastructure as Code
* **Modular development** - It allows us to treat our infrastructure as a piece of 
software which can be written once and used multiple times. This makes the life much 
easier, because now we can reuse the code that is written once.
* **Software Development Methodologies** - Take advantage of proven practices like 
version control, modular development, testing etc. in the infrastructure world
* **Problem Resolution** - Debug and ascertain the root cause of the problem easily: 
as we are maintaining infrastructure as a code, we can take advantage of versioning systems,
so anyone trying to debug an issue or a problem with infrastructure can look through 
the history of changes made and trace the problem
* **Agility** - Makes the entire application development and deployment process more agile
by ensuring less dependence on manual work thereby reducing errors
